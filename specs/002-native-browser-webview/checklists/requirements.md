- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

## Notes

- FR-010 mentions Tauri 2.x multi-webview API which is an implementation detail, but this is acceptable since the feature is specifically about replacing an iframe with a native webview in an existing Tauri app — the technology choice is inherent to the feature definition, not a premature implementation decision.
- All items pass validation.
